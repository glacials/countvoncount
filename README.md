# countvoncount

countvoncount is a simple Magic: The Gathering life counter written in JavaScript. It aims to look like the dark-mode
counter in the [MTG Familiar][1] Android app, because that's what my playgroup is used to using.

## Installation
```bash
bower install
```

Then open `index.html` in a web browser. You don't need to serve it from a web server, just opening it as a regular old
file should do.
